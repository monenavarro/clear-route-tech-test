# 🧪 Welcome to the ClearRoute Tech Tests 

## Stage 1 Task (Python 🐍)

You are working as part of an insurance company as an engineer. Customer Support has just identified a problem with one of our service applications. For an unknown reason, our latest customers between ages 40 and 59 have paid an incorrect amount for their insurance products.

We need to identify the affected customers and notify Customer Support with the customer's name, phone number and email address inside a .txt file.

## Setup 

* Clone this repo using this command: git clone https://github.com/monenavarro/clear-route-tech-test.git 
* This command should work to run the code from the terminal(ensure you are in the correct directory): `python stage-1/filter_search.py`  
* Use this command to run tests: `python unit-tests/csv-test.py`

## Expected Output
A new .txt file should be created when the code is run to produce the list of affected customers with their relevant details.
